// 12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var friends = ["Huzaifa", "Raza", "Ali", "Asad"];
var massage1 = "You are nice person";
console.log(friends[0], massage1);
console.log(friends[1], massage1);
console.log(friends[2], massage1);
console.log(friends[3], massage1);
